            Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that may be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.
            <br>
            The infection causes the lungs' air sacs (alveoli) to become inflamed and fill up with fluid or pus. 
            <br>
            That can make it hard for the oxygen you breathe in to get into your bloodstream.
            <br>
            The symptoms of pneumonia can range from mild to severe, and include cough, fever, chills, and trouble breathing.
            <br>
            Many factors affect how serious a case of pneumonia is, such as the type of germ causing the lung infection,
            <br>
             the personâ€™s age, and their overall health. The people most at risk are infants and young children, adults 65 or older,
             <br> and people who have other health problems.
            <br>
            Pneumonia is a leading cause of hospitalization in both children and adults. Most cases can be treated successfully, 
            <br>
            although it can take weeks to fully recover. Tens of thousands of people in the U.S. die from pneumonia every year,
            <br> most of them adults over the age of 65.
